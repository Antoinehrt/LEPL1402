# Module 3

Arborescent data structures, Object Oriented Programming (inheritance, generics, etc)

## Goals

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Use and implement arborescent and recursive data structures (trees, lists, â€¦)
- Understand and implement traversal algorithms over trees and lists (prefix, infix, suffix)
- Be able to analyze the time complexity of algorithms over arborescent data-structures
- Understand serialization of arborescent data structures
