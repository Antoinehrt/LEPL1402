# LEPL1402 | Informatic

BAC2 course in Java8. Mastering OOP, Functional Programming, Complexity, Design Patterns/Architecture, Parallelism and more.

This github keeps track of the progress during the course with all the codes I created to solve the given problems.
Unfortunately, I can't put in here the MCQs that served as a theorical knowledge test tool.
